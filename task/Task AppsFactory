Task AppsFactory


Develop a music management app for android based on the LastFM API.

With help of the app the user should be able to search for artists and pick one of the top albums which can be locally saved.

The app should contain the following screens:

1) Main Screen: 
		All locally stored albums are shown here. A tap on one of these albums opens a detail-page. 
		With help of an entry in the menu it’s possible to go to the search screen.

2) Search Page: 
	On this page it should be possible to search for an artist on the LastFM Api. Furthermore there should be a button next to a text field which starts the search. The results of the search should be shown in a list. 
	A selection of one list-item opens the albums-overview screen.

3)	Top-Alben: The best albums of an artist are shown here. It should be possible to store (and delete stored) albums locally. 
			   Tap on an album opens the detail-page. 
			   At least the following informations should be stored:

Name
Artist
Image (doesn’t matter in which size)
Tracks

4) Detail page: Tap on an album opens the detail-page.
